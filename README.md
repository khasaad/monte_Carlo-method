<h3>Monte-Carlo method to estimate PI.</h3>

<p>The calculation of π by the Monte-Carlo method consists of randomly drawing numbers x and y in the interval [0; 1].</p> </p>

<p>If x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> < 1 the point M (x, y) belongs to a quarter disk of radius 1. The probability that this is so is the ratio of the areas of the quarter disk of radius 1 and the square of side 1 and let π / 4.

In this applet n is the total number of points generated by a pseudo-random sequence, p is the number of points inside the quarter disc and 4 p / n therefore gives an approximate value of π. </p>
